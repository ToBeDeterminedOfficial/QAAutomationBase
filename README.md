# QAAutomationBase

This repo contains a base project for setting up black-box automated testing for web applications.

This is primarily based on robot framework: https://github.com/robotframework/RobotDemo

We are also using the selenium plugin for the robot framework: https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html
